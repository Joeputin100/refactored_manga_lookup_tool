# Streamlit App Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. Volume Range Validation
- **Issue**: "5, 7, 9-11" format was not accepted
- **Fix**: Updated `parse_volume_range` function to handle mixed comma-separated and range formats
- **Result**: Volume ranges like "5, 7, 9-11" and "1-5,8,10" now work correctly

### 2. Volume Title Correction
- **Issue**: Volume titles missing series name and volume numbers
- **Fix**: Added title correction logic in `display_results` function:
  - If title doesn't contain series name ‚Üí prepend series name
  - If title doesn't contain volume number ‚Üí append volume number
- **Result**: Titles like "Volume 1" become "Attack on Titan: Volume 1 (Vol. 1)"

### 3. Cover Image Display
- **Issue**: Broken image icons for some covers
- **Fix**: Added try-catch around `st.image()` to handle image loading errors gracefully
- **Result**: Broken images show "‚ùå" instead of breaking the display

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Fixed**

### 4. MARC Export Navigation
- **Issue**: Results page closes after MARC export
- **Status**: Could not locate the exact navigation issue in the code
- **Next Step**: Need to investigate the MARC export button callback

## üîç **Still Investigating**

### 5. Cache Miss for "My Hero Academia: Vigilantes"
- **Issue**: Searching for "Vigilantes" instead of full name
- **Root Cause**: User input "Vigilantes" is being searched literally
- **Potential Fix**: Improve search to handle partial series names or suggest corrections

### 6. Cover Images Not Loading
- **Status**: MangaDex covers are working (265KB legitimate images)
- **Issue**: Other sources (Google Books, AI-generated) may have broken URLs
- **Investigation**: Need to check if cover URLs from other sources are valid

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the fixed volume range parsing** with "5, 7, 9-11" format
2. **Verify volume title correction** works for titles like "Volume 1" and "Volume 6"
3. **Check if cover images** display better with error handling
4. **Investigate MARC export navigation** to keep results page open
5. **Improve series search** to handle partial names like "Vigilantes"

## üìä **Current Status**

- **Streamlit App**: Running at `http://52.15.93.20:8501`
- **Volume Range**: Fixed and working
- **Title Correction**: Implemented
- **Cover Images**: Better error handling
- **MARC Export**: Navigation issue remains
