In the dark, untamed wilderness between towns, giant armored insects known as Gaichuu roam. To connect the hearts of the people, a brave corps of couriers called 'Letter Bees' (Tegami Bachi) risk their lives to deliver letters. The series follows Lag Seeing, a young boy who was once delivered as a 'letter' himself by the Letter Bee Gauche Suede. Inspired by Gauche, Lag becomes a Letter Bee, accompanied by his dingo (bodyguard) Niche and her 'pet' Steak, to deliver people's 'hearts' and search for the man who set him on this path.",
