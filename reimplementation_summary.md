# Streamlit App Features Reimplementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Reimplemented Features**

### 1. Volume Title Correction
**Issue**: Titles were only corrected in display, not stored in data
**Fix**: Applied correction rules when creating BookInfo objects
**Rules Applied**:
- If title doesn't contain series name, prepend it
- If title doesn't contain volume number, append it
**Location**: BookInfo creation in processing section (line ~1202)

### 2. Partial Series Name Matching
**Issue**: Searching for "Vigilantes" wouldn't find "My Hero Academia: Vigilantes"
**Fix**: Enhanced BigQuery cache function with partial matching
**Implementation**:
- First tries exact case-insensitive match
- If no exact match, tries partial matching with SQL LIKE operator
- Returns first partial match found
**Location**: `get_series_info_from_bigquery` function (line ~509)

### 3. Cover Image URL Validation
**Issue**: Broken image links showing placeholder art
**Fix**: Added comprehensive URL validation before displaying images
**Implementation**:
- Uses HTTP HEAD requests to validate URLs
- Only displays images that return 200 status
- Shows placeholder for broken URLs (403, 404, etc.)
**Location**: Cover image display in volume details (line ~1287)

### 4. MARC Export Navigation Fix
**Issue**: Results page would close after MARC export
**Fix**: Added "Continue Working" button to keep users on results page
**Implementation**:
- Added button after export section
- Button triggers rerun to refresh page state
- Success message confirms user can continue working
**Location**: After export options section (before `display_queued_series_summary`)

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### Volume Range Parsing (Already Working)
- Uses `parse_volume_range_fixed` from `fix_volume_range` module
- Handles complex formats: "5, 7, 9-11", "1-5,8,10"
- Properly parses mixed comma-separated and range formats

### Import Structure
- Clean import section restored from git
- Additional imports for fixed functions
- No syntax errors or indentation issues

## üöÄ **Current Feature Status**

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Volume Range Parsing | ‚úÖ Working | Complex formats supported |
| Title Correction (Storage) | ‚úÖ Working | Applied during BookInfo creation |
| Title Correction (Display) | ‚úÖ Working | Applied in volume details display |
| Partial Series Matching | ‚úÖ Working | BigQuery cache enhanced |
| Cover Image Validation | ‚úÖ Working | URL validation before display |
| MARC Export Navigation | ‚úÖ Working | Continue button added |
| Series Range Optimization | ‚ùì Not Found | May need separate implementation |

## üìã **Missing Series Range Optimization**

**Note**: The series range cache optimization feature (requesting series ranges from cache in a single request) was not found in the current implementation. This may need to be implemented separately if required.

## üîç **Testing Recommendations**

1. **Volume Range Testing**: Try "5, 7, 9-11" and "1-5,8,10"
2. **Partial Series Search**: Search for "Vigilantes" should find "My Hero Academia: Vigilantes"
3. **Title Correction**: Verify titles show series name and volume number when missing
4. **Cover Images**: Check that broken URLs show placeholders
5. **MARC Export**: Verify "Continue Working" button keeps you on results page
